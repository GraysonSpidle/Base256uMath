If--for whatever reason--you are someone that wants to contribute to this repository, then I have a few things for you.

As you might be aware, this repository is licensed with the unlicense. Meaning it belongs to the public domain and I wish to keep it that way.

I'm no lawyer and I don't want to deal with waiver agreements. I just want to code, because I love to code.
